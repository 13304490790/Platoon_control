## Supervisor:
Prof. Philippe Martinet (Ecole Centrale Nantes, France)

## Features:
  1. Implements a hybrid controller for communication between vehicles and between leader and followers in a platoon of vehicles. 
  2. Robustness of the controller is tested by adding perturbation.
  3. Trajectory generation done through B-splines. 
  4. PID v/s Sliding mode controller studied
  
## Requirements:
1. MATLAB 2015 (or later)
2. Simulink libraries

## How to run:
1. run: run_it.m
2. run: Platoon_Local_new_2015a.slx or Platoon_Global_new_2015a.slx or Platoon_Hybrid_new_2015a.slx
3. run: ResultsPlatoon.m
